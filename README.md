IMAGE CLASSIFICATION ON MINIST HANDWRITTEN DIGIT DATASET

Project Overview:

This project focuses on image classification using the MNIST Handwritten Digits dataset, which contains grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can correctly identify the digit present in an input image.
The MNIST dataset is widely used as a beginner-friendly benchmark in machine learning and deep learning because of its simplicity and effectiveness in demonstrating classification techniques.

Dataset Description:

Dataset Name: MNIST Handwritten Digits
Number of Images: 70,000
60,000 training images
10,000 testing images
Image Size: 28 × 28 pixels
Color Format: Grayscale
Classes: Digits from 0 to 9
Each image represents a single handwritten digit with a corresponding label.

Technologies & Libraries Used
Python
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / Keras (based on implementation)
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

Model Description
The project involves:
Loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset
Normalizing image pixel values
Training a classification model
Evaluating the model using accuracy and test data
Predicting digits from unseen handwritten images
Different models such as:
Logistic Regression
Neural Networks
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
can be used for experimentation and performance comparison.

Results
The trained model achieves high accuracy on the test dataset.
The model successfully predicts handwritten digits from 0 to 9.
Visualization of predictions helps understand model performance.
